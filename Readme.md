# Markdown
**Markdown** is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. **Markdown** allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

**Markdown** can be written in a basic text editor (don't use Word) like TextEdit for Mac (save as plain-text) or _Notepad on Windows_. It's an easy way to write text that easily translates into HTML. The web is written in HTML, so think of it like quick-start web development tool for content editors. When you write in **Markdown**, you save the document with the file extension **.md.** More often than not, you'll never need to save a **Markdown** document, because you'll be using an online tool.
